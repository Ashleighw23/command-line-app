## Description

I created this project to better my knowlage in building a ReadMe from a command line application, using an inquire package. This allows me to have more time to work on a project. During this assignment I learned how to use node.js and packages to make coding quicker and easier.

## Installation

I had to connect my index.js to my generateMarkdown.js to allow my codes from different files to wrok together. I had to install an inquirer package and then create the template literals to create the right questions in Terminal. In generalMarkdown.js I created an outline for my READMe and used a data atribute to import information from index.js.
